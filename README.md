This repository consists of a project focused on analyzing and predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes. The application is built with Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for users to explore and predict diabetes. We have compared the two models and implemented the Logistic Regression Algorithm manually.
